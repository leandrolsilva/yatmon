yet another task list with MongoDB

A simple task list using flask (python) and MongoDB...

I need a task list... there are a lot of solution, but I need learn more about NOSQL (I decided use MongoDB) and try learn how to make a responsive layout. So, this is my proof of concept =]

The plan
===

Using a responsive interface, create a simple and fast way to create and organize my tasks. I usually check my emails many times per day, so I need notifications about my commitments in my email box.

My backend is: 
* Python -> Flask
* MongoDB -> NOSQL

Frontend:
* <del> AngularJS</del> Bootstrap -> I need more tests with flask + AngularJS.

Let's to code!
